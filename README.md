# Breathe
An app that promotes mental well-being through practices such as meditation and journaling

What does it do?
Breathe allows the user to explore various techniques and practices to help manage stress and anxiety such as meditation and journalling. There are 4 features:

1. Zen - User is able to choose how long they would like to meditate for as well as the type of meditation (e.g., sleep, anxiety, relax) to engage in some calming of the mind.

2. Journal - Users can type out their thoughts to reflect on their day. The app will automatically save the inputted text and save it into a text file.

3.Progress - Here the user is able to select a goal they would like to focus on whether it be ‘self-compassion’ or ‘sleep.’ 
The user is then asked to rate how they feel about their goal on a scale of 1-5, in which the data is stored and computed into a graph. This allows the user to track their progress through reports over time.

4.Resources - In this section, the app recommends resources such as books and podcasts that focus on mental health and mental well-being.


As beginner python coders, we decided to use Google Colab (python Version 2.7) so our team could code and edit at the same time. 
We worked separately to create different parts of our programs (separate were built by separate people) and then compiled them together to create an overall product. 
Simultaneously, we used Framer to create a prototype that reflected our Python code. 
At any point we did not know something, we tried to reach out to mentors or watch videos on YouTube to learn ourselves.
